README.txt for stasm/png
------------------------

These are the PNG and ZLIB files necessary for stasm.  I built the
libraries with Visual C 6.0.  The makefiles I used to build the
libraries are png/zlib/Makefile-stasm.msc and png/pnglib/Makefile-stasm.msc.  
The original makefiles (published with the libraries) may be ok too.
